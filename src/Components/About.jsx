        Recently I graduated from the Flatiron school's software immersive bootcamp, I learned so much
        from that experience and gain many new friends along the way. The primary stack is Ruby and Javascript. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something, build upon a solid foundation of programming knowledge.
        <br/><br/>My hobbies include snowboarding, hiking, camping, guitar playing, archery, disc golf and of course programming. <br/><br/>
